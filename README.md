# SRN_YOLO
Enhancing Small Object Detection in Complex Foreground-Background Scenarios
# Abstract
In the realm of small target detection, accurately pinpointing foreground objects amidst intricate background similarities faces a rigorous challenge. To address this problem, we propose SRN_YOLO, a novel small object detection framework tailored for scenarios plagued by foreground-background confusion. SRN_YOLO builds upon YOLOv8s, incorporating three key enhancements: a Separated Global Context attention mechanism to highlight small targets amidst complex backgrounds, a Residual Context Aggregation module to mitigate irrelevant background noise, and No Stride Convolution techniques to minimize feature loss during convolution. Extensive experiments on the PCB and DIOR datasets demonstrate SRN_YOLO's superior performance, achieving mAP scores of 98.7% and 88.5%, respectively. This work contributes to advancing small object detection accuracy and robustness in practical applications.
